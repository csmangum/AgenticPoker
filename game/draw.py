def handle_draw_phase(players: List[Player], deck: Deck) -> None:
    """
    Handle the draw phase where players can discard and draw new cards.

    This phase allows each player who hasn't folded to:
    1. Decide which cards to discard (0-5 cards)
    2. Discard selected cards (added to deck's discard pile)
    3. Draw an equal number of replacement cards

    If the deck runs low on cards during draws, discarded cards are
    automatically reshuffled back into the deck.

    Args:
        players: List of players in the game. Each player must have:
            - folded (bool): Whether they've folded
            - hand: Current hand of cards
            - decide_draw(): Method returning list of card indexes to discard
        deck: The deck to draw new cards from. Must support:
            - deal(): Drawing new cards
            - add_discarded(): Adding cards to discard pile
            - reshuffle_discards(): Reshuffling discards back into deck

    Raises:
        InvalidActionError: If a player tries to discard invalid card indexes
        PokerGameError: For other game-related errors during the draw phase

    Note:
        - Players who have folded are skipped
        - If a player's decide_draw() raises an exception, they keep their current hand
        - Logging is used to track player actions and error conditions
