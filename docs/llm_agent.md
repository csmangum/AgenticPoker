The **LLM Poker Agent** is an advanced AI poker player designed to simulate human-like decision-making, interpret opponent behavior, and communicate effectively during gameplay. Powered by natural language processing (NLP), the agent combines poker domain expertise with configurable personality traits, cognitive mechanisms, and a persistent memory system for enhanced gameplay. 

The system's design emphasizes adaptability, efficiency, and intuitive resource management, making it ideal for a variety of poker scenarios.

## Key Features

### 1. **Memory System Optimization**
The agent employs a focused memory retrieval mechanism to ensure efficient decision-making by prioritizing only the most relevant historical experiences. 

#### Implementation:
The memory system now retrieves a reduced number of past events (`k=2`), avoiding information overload while maintaining context. 

```python
def decide_action(self, game_state: str, opponent_message: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    """Strategically decides the next action using focused memory retrieval."""
    # Retrieve recent relevant memories
    relevant_memories = self.memory_store.get_relevant_memories(
        query=game_state,
        k=2  # Reduced for streamlined processing
    )
    
    # Format memory context
    memory_context = ""
    if relevant_memories:
        memory_context = "\nRecent relevant experiences:\n" + "\n".join(
            [f"- {mem['text']}" for mem in relevant_memories]
        )

    # Combine current state with memory context
    prompt = self._get_decision_prompt(game_state + memory_context)
    # Further processing of the prompt...
```

#### Benefits:
- Improved decision accuracy by avoiding over-weighting past events.
- Reduced computational overhead for memory context preparation.

### 2. **Session-Specific Memory**
To enhance efficiency and isolate game-specific data, the memory system now uses session-specific collections. This allows for tailored memory management for each poker session.

#### Implementation:
```python
# Initialize session-specific memory store
collection_name = f"agent_{name.lower().replace(' ', '_')}_{session_id}_memory"
self.memory_store = ChromaMemoryStore(collection_name)
```

#### Benefits:
- Improved memory organization across multiple sessions.
- Enhanced contextual relevance during decision-making.

### 3. **Resource Management Enhancements**
The agent now incorporates robust resource handling mechanisms, ensuring proper cleanup and minimizing resource leaks.

#### Context Management:
The agent supports both explicit and implicit resource cleanup through context management.

```python
# Method 1: Explicit cleanup
agent = LLMAgent(name="Bot1")
try:
    # Use the agent for gameplay...
finally:
    agent.close()

# Method 2: Context manager (preferred)
with LLMAgent(name="Bot2") as agent:
    # Use the agent for gameplay...
    # Resources are cleaned up automatically when the block exits
```

#### Benefits:
- Automatic and explicit cleanup options prevent resource leaks.
- Simplified agent lifecycle management for developers.

### 4. **Best Practices**
To maximize the agent's effectiveness and ensure stability, adhere to the following best practices:

#### Memory Management:
- **Session-Specific Collections:** Use distinct collections for each game session.
- **Memory Retrieval Limits:** Keep `k=2` for memory retrieval to avoid overloading decision prompts.
- **Explicit History Cleanup:** Clear perception and conversation histories explicitly when appropriate.

#### Resource Handling:
- Use **context managers** for automatic resource cleanup.
- Implement the `close()` method for manual cleanup as needed.
- Ensure in-memory data structures are cleared properly.

#### Error Handling:
- Suppress non-critical errors during interpreter shutdown.
- Log warnings for cleanup issues without affecting gameplay.
- Implement retry mechanisms for LLM queries.
- Provide fallback behaviors to handle query failures gracefully.

## Summary
The **LLM Poker Agent** represents a fusion of advanced NLP capabilities and optimized memory and resource management strategies. By isolating session-specific contexts, streamlining memory retrieval, and improving resource cleanup, the agent is equipped to deliver consistent, strategic, and human-like gameplay experiences.
