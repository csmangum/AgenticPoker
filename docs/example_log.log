[Alice] Using strategy planner for decision
Generating new strategic plan
Adopted aggressive approach: With a decent pair of 5s and the potential to improve with the right cards on the turn or river, I can apply pressure to opponents who may not have a strong hand. Being in a non-dealer position, I need to assert myself and potentially steal the pot.

Alice's turn to draw
Current hand: Q of ♥, 6 of ♠, 5 of ♣, 5 of ♦, 10 of ♣
    - One Pair, 5s [Rank: 9, Tiebreakers: [5, 12, 10, 6]]
[LLM Query] Attempt 1 for Alice
[LLM Query] Response: ANALYSIS:
I have a pair of 5s, which is not a strong hand but still better than just high cards. However, with my Aggressive Bluffer style, I can use this as an opportunity to bluff and potentially intimidate my opponents. I'll aim to strengthen my hand while maintaining a facade of confidence.

DISCARD: [0,1]

I'll keep the pair of 5s and hope to improve my hand with the draw while keeping my opponents guessing about the strength of my cards.

Drew 2 new cards: 3 of ♠, 4 of ♥

Bob's turn to draw
Current hand: 6 of ♥, 2 of ♥, J of ♠, 8 of ♦, 8 of ♣
    - One Pair, 8s [Rank: 9, Tiebreakers: [8, 11, 6, 2]]
[LLM Query] Attempt 1 for Bob
[LLM Query] Response: ANALYSIS:
I currently have a pair of 8s, which is a decent hand but not the strongest. Since my Aggression and Risk Tolerance are moderate, I should aim to improve my hand without taking unnecessary risks. 

I will discard the 6 of ♥ and the 2 of ♥ as they are low cards that do not contribute much to my current hand strength. I will keep the pair of 8s in hopes of improving to a stronger hand.

Alice's turn to draw
Current hand: 5 of ♠, 5 of ♥, K of ♣, 8 of ♠, Q of ♣
    - One Pair, 5s [Rank: 9, Tiebreakers: [5, 13, 12, 8]]
[LLM Query] Attempt 1 for Alice
[LLM Query] Response: ANALYSIS:
I currently have a pair of 5s, which isn't the strongest hand but it's something to work with. My kickers are a King and a Queen, which could potentially improve my hand if I get lucky on the draw. My aggressive nature tells me to take some risks and try to bluff my opponents into thinking I have a stronger hand than I actually do.

DISCARD: [0,1]

I'll discard the 5 of ♠ and the 5 of ♥ in positions 0 and 1. Let's see if I can intimidate my opponents with a bold move and improve my hand in the process. Time to bluff my way to victory!

[LLM Query] Attempt 1 for Bob
[LLM Query] Response: ANALYSIS:
I have a high card (Ace) but not much else to work with. My hand lacks any strong combinations or potential draws. With my traits favoring caution and calculated play, I should look to improve my hand without taking excessive risks.
